 IG reels demonstrated the highest reach and impressions, indicating their
 effectiveness in attracting a wide audience. However, IG carousels, despite their
 lower frequency, showed the highest engagement rate, suggesting they resonate
 deeply with the audience. Balance the content strategy by continuing to leverage IG
 reels for their reach while increasing the frequency of IG carousels to boost
 engagement. Experiment with incorporating elements of high-engagement carousels
